# NYC Schools

**Objective**
Create a native app to provide information on NYC High schools.

1.	Display a list of NYC High Schools. 
    School data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
2.	Selecting a school should show additional information about the school 
    Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing.

**What is important**
- Use Java as the primary language. Kotlin can be used as well but focus on java.
- Proper function â€“ requirements met.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
- Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

**Bonus**
- Unit Tests

### Dev Note
Wrapping up development for now. For a proper user experience I would have liked to include:
- explanation of the value add in an intro / walk-through so that the user knows what a "thumbs up" means
- filtering on the main menu so that the list of schools isn't quite as heavy
- transparency around schools that don't get the "thumbs up", want to make sure we separate the schools
we know about and the ones we just don't have enough info on
- unit tests, so the user always gets what the user wants

Used java for the first half then I switched to Kotlin so there's a mix of both in there.
