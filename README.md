**What is important**
- Use Java as the primary language. Kotlin can be used as well but focus on java.
- Proper function â€“ requirements met.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
- Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

**Bonus**
- Unit Tests
